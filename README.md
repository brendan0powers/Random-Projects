Random Projects
===============
This repository contains some projects I've worked on. Most of them are incomplete, or abandoned. However, I decided to post them here so that I would not loose track of them. Below is a list of the projects in this repository.

headphonectl
------------
Allows the use of the special keys on the Logitech G930 wireless headset in Linux. It has modules for controlling VLC, a UPnP media server, and a live audio stream from another sound card.

NetFS
-----
A network file system using the FUSE file system layer. It's designed to mount network file system (SMB, NFS, etc..) to a folder in a users home directory.

QxtIrc
------
An IRC client library and bot framework writen using the Qt library. This project was a collaboration with several people. It was designed to be simple to use, and several interesting IRC bots were created using it.

MobileIRC
------
A Windows Mobile IRC client writen using the QxtIrc library. It worked fairly well. However, it only joined one channel.
